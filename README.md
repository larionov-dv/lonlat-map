A small web application that displays a world map with meridians and parallels â€“ a feature that unfortunately lacks on Google Maps. The application is written with React, using the [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) library to display the map. The [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is used as a map source. Use `npm start` to run the application locally or `npm build` to make a production build. Also, a ready-to-use version of the application is available at [https://map.larionov.site](https://map.larionov.site).
